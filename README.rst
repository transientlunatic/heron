The ``heron`` package is a python library for using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to emulate functions which are expensive to compute.

The ``heron`` package was designed to provide an easy-to-use interface to the ``heron`` waveform model, which is a Gaussian process surrogate model for binary black hole coalescence waveforms.
A number of models are available for use in the package, and these are described in detail in the product documentation, and outlined in this README.
