# Training data
training:
  data_file: training_data_test.h5  # Path to HDF5 file from training-data command
  group_name: IMR_training_test      # Must match the group from training data generation

# Model naming
model_name: gpr_imr_nonspin  # Name for the trained model states

# Training hyperparameters
hyperparameters:
  iterations: 1000              # Number of training iterations
  learning_rate: 0.01           # Adam optimizer learning rate (lower = more stable)
  output_scale: 1.0             # Not used anymore - data is auto-normalized
  warp_scale: 2                 # Time warping factor for pre-merger
  checkpoint_frequency: 100     # Save diagnostics every N iterations
  validation_samples: 5000      # Subsample for memory efficiency (remove for all data)
