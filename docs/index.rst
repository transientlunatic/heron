Heron : The Waveform Emulator
=============================

`Heron` is a Python package for producing surrogate models for computationally intensive functions, such as numerical relativity
waveforms.

This version of heron is implemented slightly differently to older versions,
and should allow for a greater degree of flexibility for using different GP libraries for the modelling,
and to fit into analysis pipelines better than the earlier development versions.
