Heron : The Waveform Emulator
=============================

`Heron` is a Python package for producing surrogate models for computationally intensive functions, such as numerical relativity
waveforms.

This version of heron is implemented slightly differently to older versions, and should allow for a greater degree of flexibility for using different GP libraries for the modelling, and to fit into analysis pipelines better than the earlier development versions.

Pre-supplied Models
===================

This package contains a number of different pre-baked waveform models, and the data which is required to reproduce them.
